### What is LD-based local haplotyping

Local haplotyping involves classifying individuals by shared haplotypes 
(combinations of alleles) across loci within a region of interest. 

LD-based local haplotyping approaches seek to capture variation patterns in a 
wider region by only considering representatives of tightly linked groups of 
SNPs that are defined either through 'tagging' or as in the case of crosshap, 
clustering variants. In crosshap, these representative clusters are termed 
'Marker Groups' ('MGs').

In this UMAP which captures some of the pairwise linkage relationships between 
SNPs, distinct Marker Groups of clustered SNPs are coloured.

The goal of crosshap is not to cluster all, or even a majority of SNPs across
the region, but rather to identify major tightly linked Marker groups with 
typically co-inherited alleles that can be used to define the local haplotypes.

<<Explain haplotype groups



When effectively used, crosshap intuitively shows the relationships between 
phenotypic variation, genomic variation, and population structure in the region.
